## 🚀 Full-stack E-commerce Platform  

**Tech Stack**: Next.js (React) | Node.js (Express.js/Nest.js) | PostgreSQL | Stripe | TypeScript  

### 📌 Project Overview  
This is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed for seamless online shopping. It includes essential e-commerce functionalities such as a shopping cart, user authentication, product management, and order checkout. The project follows best practices and supports JWT/OAuth login and Stripe payments.

To maintain **cleaner architecture** and **reduce nesting complexity**, the frontend and backend are developed as separate services. This separation allows for:
- **Better maintainability**: The frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js/NestJS) are modular and easier to manage.
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently as needed.
- **Clearer separation of concerns**: The frontend handles UI/UX, while the backend manages business logic, authentication, and database interactions.
- **Reduced nesting issues**: Keeping frontend and backend logic separate avoids deep file structures and unnecessary dependencies, leading to **cleaner, more readable code**.
